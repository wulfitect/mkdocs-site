# Recommended Designs for VXLAN-EVPN

This section outlines several design recommendations for deploying VXLAN-EVPN in modern networks.

## Design Principles

- **Scalability:** Leverage EVPN as a control plane to support large-scale deployments with minimal configuration.
- **Resiliency:** Implement dual-homing and multi-homing to eliminate single points of failure.
- **Separation of Data and Control Planes:** Use VXLAN overlays for data traffic and EVPN for control signaling.
- **Security & Segmentation:** Use VRFs and route-targets for tenant isolation.

## Cisco Recommended Design

- **Leaf-Spine Architecture:** Utilize a two-tier fabric with leaf and spine switches.
- **Centralized Control:** Deploy route reflectors to distribute EVPN routes.
- **Robust Underlay:** Ensure an IP multicast or head-end replication mechanism is in place.

## Juniper Recommended Design

- **EVPN-VXLAN Fabric:** Use Juniperâ€™s QFX or EX series in an EVPN control plane deployment.
- **Virtual Chassis Options:** Consider virtual chassis or stacking to simplify network management.
- **Integrated Routing:** Utilize Junos BGP for seamless underlay and overlay integration.

## Multi-Vendor Considerations

- **Interoperability:** Ensure all devices adhere to industry standards.
- **Consistent Policies:** Apply uniform configuration and security policies across different vendor platforms.
