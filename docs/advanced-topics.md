# Advanced Topics in VXLAN-EVPN

This section covers advanced concepts and additional considerations for production deployments.

## Security Enhancements

- **Segment Isolation:** Use VRFs and route-targets to isolate tenant traffic.
- **Encryption:** Consider IPsec for securing underlay communications.
- **Access Control:** Implement firewall policies on the leaf devices.

## Automation and Orchestration

- **Configuration Management:** Use tools like Ansible or SaltStack to automate device configurations.
- **Dynamic Provisioning:** Integrate with SDN controllers for dynamic network changes.
- **Monitoring & Telemetry:** Leverage streaming telemetry for real-time network insights.

## Integration with Existing Infrastructure

- **Legacy Networks:** Plan for coexistence with traditional L2/L3 networks.
- **Interoperability:** Verify compatibility between Cisco NX-OS and Junos platforms.
- **Migration Strategies:** Develop phased migration plans to minimize disruption.
